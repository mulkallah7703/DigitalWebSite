You are a senior Frontend Engineer, Full-Stack Developer, and expert UI/UX designer.

YOUR TASK:
Build a COMPLETE, PRODUCTION-READY, MODERN personal portfolio website from A to Z for a software engineer.

Important:
- Output ONLY CODE inside markdown code blocks, separated by file name comments.
- Do NOT explain anything unless I ask later.
- The result must be a fully responsive, modern, beautiful portfolio that I can deploy directly (e.g., on Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).


1) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

- Technology stack: pure HTML5, modern CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript (no React/Angular/Vue).
- Project structure:

  /index.html
  /assets/css/style.css
  /assets/js/main.js
  /assets/img/  (use placeholder paths; I’ll replace images later)

- Responsive design: fully responsive for mobile, tablet, laptop, and large screens.
- Design style:
  - Clean, modern, minimal, premium look.
  - Combination of a light/dark vibe (e.g., dark background with vibrant accent color).
  - Use CSS variables for colors and typography to make it easy to customize.
  - Smooth sections, plenty of whitespace, and elegant spacing.

- Typography:
  - Use modern Google Fonts (for example: "Poppins" for headings and "Inter" or "Open Sans" for body text).
  - Define CSS variables for font sizes and weights for consistency.

- Animations & interactions:
  - Smooth scrolling navigation between sections.
  - Subtle hover effects on buttons, cards, and links.
  - Fade-in / slide-up animations when sections enter the viewport (implemented via JavaScript + CSS).
  - Animated “typing effect” in the hero section for job titles.

- SEO & meta:
  - Proper <title>, <meta description>, and basic SEO tags.
  - Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url).
  - Favicon link (I will replace the file later).


2) CONTENT & SECTIONS

The portfolio should be a single, elegant one-page layout with these sections in this order:

0. Sticky Header & Navigation
1. Hero Section (Intro)
2. About Section
3. Skills Section
4. Projects Section
5. Experience / Timeline Section
6. Services / What I Do
7. Testimonials (optional but nice)
8. Contact Section
9. Footer

Use IDs for sections for navigation (e.g., #home, #about, #skills, #projects, #experience, #services, #testimonials, #contact).


0) HEADER & NAVBAR

- Sticky header that stays at the top when scrolling.
- Logo on the left (text logo with my name).
- Navigation links on the right: Home, About, Skills, Projects, Experience, Services, Testimonials, Contact.
- On mobile:
  - Use a hamburger menu that opens/closes a slide-down nav.
  - Implement with JavaScript (no external libraries).


1) HERO SECTION (HOME)

- Full viewport height hero.
- Left side: Text content.
- Right side: Circular or rounded image placeholder for my profile picture.

Hero content (use placeholders that I can easily edit later):

- Name: [YOUR_FULL_NAME]
- Main title: "Software Engineer & Digital Entrepreneur"
- Typing effect for multiple roles, e.g.:
  - "Full-Stack Developer"
  - "Prompt Engineer"
  - "AI & Automation Enthusiast"
  - "Digital Products Creator"

- Short powerful summary (2–3 lines) that highlights:
  - Building modern web applications.
  - Working with AI tools & prompts.
  - Creating digital products and automations.

- Two main CTA buttons:
  - "View My Work" → scroll to Projects section.
  - "Download CV" → link to a placeholder PDF (e.g., assets/cv/my-cv.pdf).

- Small social icons row (GitHub, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Email) using SVG or icon fonts (if needed use simple inline SVG or text placeholders).


2) ABOUT SECTION

- Section title: "About Me".
- A subheading like: "Who I Am" or "A bit about my journey".
- A 2–3 paragraph text area where I can talk about myself. Use placeholder text but structured for a software engineer who:
  - Studies Software Engineering.
  - Loves AI, robotics, and building digital products.
  - Works on hackathons, freelance projects, and content creation.

- On the side, include a small “quick info” card or list:
  - Name
  - Location
  - Main role
  - Years of experience (as “X+ years of coding & projects”)
  - Email (clickable mailto:[YOUR_EMAIL])


3) SKILLS SECTION

- Section title: "Skills".
- Two or three categories, for example:
  - "Frontend"
  - "Backend & Databases"
  - "Tools & Others"

- For each category, show skills as badges or progress bars.
  Example skills to include as placeholders:
  - Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap/Tailwind (as text only), Responsive Design.
  - Backend: Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, MySQL, MongoDB.
  - Tools: Git & GitHub, VS Code, n8n, Prompt Engineering, AI Tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.).

- Use a grid layout that looks modern and clean.


4) PROJECTS SECTION

- Section title: "Projects".
- Subtitle: "Some of my favorite work".

- Display projects as responsive cards (3–6 example cards) with:
  - Project image placeholder.
  - Project title.
  - Short description (1–2 lines).
  - Tags for technologies used.
  - Buttons/links: "Live Demo" and "Source Code" (GitHub link).

Example placeholder projects:
  - "Smart Rescuer AI" – portable emergency assistant device.
  - "Digital Products Hub" – platform to sell ebooks, prompts, and templates.
  - "Portfolio Generator" – web app that builds portfolio pages from prompts.
  - "Study Planner App" – tool for students to organize learning.

Each project card must have a nice hover interaction (scale, shadow, subtle movement).


5) EXPERIENCE / TIMELINE SECTION

- Section title: "Experience & Education".
- Use a vertical timeline with entries such as:
  - Year + Title + Place + short description.
  - Examples (as placeholders):
    - "2023 – Present: Software Engineering Student – [YOUR UNIVERSITY]"
    - "Freelance Web Developer – Remote"
    - "Participant in multiple hackathons in Saudi Arabia & MENA region".

- Timeline should look visual (dots + vertical line + cards).


6) SERVICES SECTION

- Section title: "What I Do".
- Cards for services such as:
  - "Web Development"
  - "Digital Products & Ebooks"
  - "Prompt Engineering & Automations"
  - "Tech Content & Training"

- Each card includes:
  - Icon or simple graphic (can be just an emoji placeholder or SVG shape).
  - Service name.
  - Short description (2–3 lines) focusing on value to the client.


7) TESTIMONIALS SECTION

- Section title: "Testimonials".
- Add 2–3 testimonial cards with:
  - Client name (placeholder).
  - Role (e.g., “Client from Upwork”).
  - Short feedback quote.
- Style them with cards and maybe a slight tilt/hover effect.


8) CONTACT SECTION

- Section title: "Contact Me".
- Subtitle: "Let’s build something together".

- Two parts:
  1) Short text + contact details (email, maybe WhatsApp/phone placeholder, location).
  2) Contact form with fields:
     - Name
     - Email
     - Subject
     - Message
     - Submit button.

- Form behavior:
  - Use JavaScript to validate (required fields, valid email format).
  - On submit, prevent actual sending but show a styled success message (e.g., a green alert that says “Your message has been sent! (This is a demo; integrate with backend later)”).


9) FOOTER

- Simple footer with:
  - © [CURRENT_YEAR] [YOUR_NAME]. All rights reserved.
  - Small links: Home, Projects, Contact (anchor links).
  - Maybe a tiny note like: "Built with ❤️ using HTML, CSS & JS".


3) DESIGN & UX DETAILS

- Use a maximum width container so the content does not stretch too wide on large screens.
- Use a consistent spacing system (e.g., multiples of 8px).
- All buttons should have:
  - Border radius (slightly rounded).
  - Hover state (change background, slightly scale up, box-shadow).
- Use a main accent color (e.g., a blue or purple) defined as a CSS variable: --accent-color.
- Define light and dark sections alternating to make the page visually interesting.


4) JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONALITY

In /assets/js/main.js implement:

1) Mobile menu toggle:
   - Toggle 'open' class for nav on click of hamburger icon.

2) Smooth scrolling:
   - When clicking on nav links, smoothly scroll to target sections.

3) Active nav link on scroll:
   - As the user scrolls, highlight the current section in the nav.

4) Intersection animations:
   - Use IntersectionObserver (or scroll event) to add 'visible' class to sections and cards when they appear in viewport.

5) Typing effect:
   - Implement a simple typing effect that loops through an array of titles (e.g., ["Full-Stack Developer", "Prompt Engineer", "Digital Products Creator"]).

6) Contact form:
   - Basic client-side validation.
   - Show success or error messages below the form.


5) OUTPUT FORMAT

VERY IMPORTANT:

- Output the code in this exact structure using markdown code fences:

  ```html
  <!-- index.html -->
  ... full HTML code here ...
